# Instructions

## üé∂ Music releases

Since the focus of this assignment is to practice with React, we've downloaded a response from the Spotify API which you can use, rather than calling the API yourself.

## üé∂ How to use the Spotify data & construct your components ü§ì

In the `/src/data.json`, we've included an API response from Spotify which contains data for 50 recent releases. You can `import` this JSON file into a component using `import data from './data.json'` (which we've already done for you in the App component).

The result of importing the JSON is a variable called `data` which includes the full JSON response. Your task is to use this, along with `.map()` to mount an 'Album' component for each album. Within those components, you could then break things up further. For example, your app could have a structure like this:

- `App` component which has the `data`
  - `Album` component which is rendered using `.map()` and which you pass the album data into using props.
    - `ArtistName` component which is rendered using `.map()` using each item in the `artists` array. The `Album` component to show the artist name and a link.

This is just a suggestion - how you decide to structure your components is completely up to you.

## Folder Structure

- App.jsx - (Parent Component) - üçø Provided in Boiler Plate üçø
- Album.jsx - (Child Component of App.jsx) - ü§ì Not Provided, to be created ü§ì
  - AlbumName.jsx - (Child Component of Album.jsx) - ü§ì Not Provided, to be created ü§ì
  - ArtistName.jsx - (Child Component of Album.jsx) - ü§ì Not Provided, to be created ü§ì
  - CoverImage.jsx - (Child Component of Album.jsx) - ü§ì Not Provided, to be created ü§ì
  - Header.jsx - (Child Component of Album.jsx) - ü§ì Not Provided, to be created ü§ì

### Extra Files

- data.json - JSON file containing 1 key called `"albums"` containing keys mimiquing a Spotify API object endpoint.

## You should display the following for each album:

- album cover image
- album name
- the name of each artist involved with a comma between

## Hover effects:

- When you hover over an album, it should go darker, and you should show a play button, a favourite button, and the ellipsis (see the design sketch)
- When you hover over the play button, it should grow (see the design sketch)
- Hovering an artist name or an album name should match the design sketch

## External Routing:

- When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external URL in the data
- When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external URL in the data

### Your page should be responsive:

- showing 4 albums per row on desktop
- 2 per row on tablet
- 1 per row on mobile.

## Design

üé∂ You should follow the design screenshots as closely as possible. We've provided icons for the play, heart and more info icons when hovering on an album. Use the following for fonts:

- Album title - 14px Helvetica #ffffff
- Artist name - 14px Helvetica #a0a0a0

  When hovering over album covers or artist names, you should implement the following hover styles:

## Requirements
- Your app should have components
- Your page should look as close as possible to the design provided.
- You should display the following for each album:
  -   album cover image
  -   album name
  -   the name of each artist involved with a comma between
- Hover effects:
  - When you hover over an album, it should go darker, and you should show a play button, a favourite button, and the ellipsis (see the design sketch)
  - When you hover over the play button, it should grow (see the design sketch)
  - Hovering an artist name or an album name should match the design sketch
- When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external url in the data
- When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external url in the data
- Your page should be responsive:
  - showing 4 albums per row on desktop
  - 2 per row on tablet
  - 1 per row on mobile.

## Stretch goals
So you‚Äôve completed the requirements? Great job! Make sure you've committed and pushed a version of your project before starting on the stretch goals. Remember that the stretch goals are optional.

### Intermediate stretch goals
- Create CSS rules or Javascript logic so that if there are only two artists you show a "&" between them, and if there are more than two artists, you show "," between all artists except the last two which should have "&":
  - *Teyana Taylor & Kehlani*
  - *Y2K, bbno$ & Enrique Iglesias*
- Lower the opacity of the play button icons and then when you hover over the play button, it should have full opacity

### Advanced stretch goals
- We've provided another API response which includes a list of popular playlists. Use this, along with some new components to render a list of playlists in a sidebar.
- Sort the albums from the singles and create two different sections on your site
- Incorporate more information from the API response to make your site richer
