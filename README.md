# Music Releases

The objetive was to create an application showing recent album and singles releases using React, to get familiar with components and props. 

## Getting Started with the Project

I had to spendmore time than usual to study the material on Technigo as well as other videos on Frontend Masters and Youtube to get going. It was har du grasp the props/data flow, and components, but once I figured out how it worked everything went fairly smooth, and felt easier. 

### The Problem

I planned the project based on the requirments of different components and designs provided, but other than that no sketch of my own. After going on to doing the stretch goals I wished I would have had an other sketch. It was har to jsut do it out of my mind. Next time I'll prep a sketch!

I went through an entire course called Javascript Intro (https://react-v8.holt.courses/). I had to look up a lot of resources on styling, even though I usually feel comfortable with styling. There where some complext parts here to figure out, like how to "stack" items, create transition effects etc. W3schools and ChatGpt where used a lot.
