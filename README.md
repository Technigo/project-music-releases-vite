# Music Releases

The assignment was to use React to create components containing information about albums from spotify, with links to artist page and album page. 
Each album should have a hover effect with buttons, and be placed in a grid that is responsive to screen.

### The Problem

I struggled with understanding the data flow in react. I spent a lot of time going through how to use props to send data to each component, chat gpt helped me a lot here. I also struggled some with getting the styling right, getting the icons to grow but stay in the exact same position, then a class mate suggested to use scale, very helpful. 
I also stuggles with getting the links of the artist name right when there was more than one, but i finally got it.
 If I had more time I would definetly try to make the sidebar as in the strech goals, just to confirm I really got the hang of working with react.
