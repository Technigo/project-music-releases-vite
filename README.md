# Music Releases

We where asked to create a music website with React.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

This week have we learned to use React, JSX, it was hard to wrok with so many files and folders and connect them with each other. I ask a coach that help me understand better how to work with react. I ask my team and the chatGPT to get some answers, I looked at questions asked on StakOverflow. I had the problem that the albumNAme and artistName was underline from a default style in the browser, I solved it by copying  the css style from the the browser and pasting it into my code on VSCode, it work perfectly.
