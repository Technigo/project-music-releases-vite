# Music Releases

The project this week was to build a music library that shows new albums and single releases, using Spotify data. To get more familiar with React, we practiced creating components and transferring data.

### The Problem

We mostly worked together doing mob programming, through the entire project. Setting up the structure and connecting the elements together. Later in the project, some features and bug fixes were worked on independently. 
Creating the structure, components, it's children's components and transferring data was pretty straight forward. The main part of the encountered problems this week had to do with the styling. We managed though to refresh our css skills and are pleased with the result.
