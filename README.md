# Music Releases



## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I struggeled getting started on this project, it took me a long time setting it up, understanding the code that was already there and how to structure it and to get started on it. 

I decided to do the css files for each child componant right away, to learn how to do it. Looking back I feel like the code is maintanable, a lot more so than going back to our weather app for example. However it was hard for me to get the import export with the data. in the begining. I started testing with <h1>text<h1> and changed it after making it work. I was getting so many errors in the beginning and spent a lot of time understanding where I was missing exports. 

Later on I struggeled with the commas. I really didnt think I would struggle this much with it. First I didn't know where to place the code, and then I would get errors all the time. I tried folowing the stackowerflow answer Technigo provided as guidance and tried both css snd js soulutions but couldn't make it work. I had to strip down my code and start with the ArtistName and then add on the header, AlbumName and the CoverImage. Looking back I wish I had done the comma straigh away, but I didn't know it would be that hard for me to add it inn. Still not sure where the problem was, because as I copied in parts of my old code to the striped down code it worked. 

Another problem I struggeled with was the icons. First I discovered they were gone. I probably deleted them by accident setting up the folders and files. After getting them back I spent a lot of time understanding where to place them(folder), but mostly where in my code to add them. I think I tried adding them to album, app and CoverImage. But couldn't get them inside the grids or on top of my CoverImages. I also couldn't target the images inside the CoverImage.module.css. Because of time running out I didn't pay to much atteintion to what actually made it work so I need to go back to the code and figure it out. I think I changed something inside my "albumWrapper" code, but I need to go back to understand it.

I feel like doing "all" parts in one assigment/or componant would have made this process easier. f.eksample: do the commas right away with the rest of the ArtistName instead of getting the text to show and then add on. Because I was so unsure if things would work I wanted to just make things appear on my page, but I donn't think this is the best strategy and I think it complicates things when I have to change codes and still don't understand them in depth. I also wish I had added the icons right asay together with the cover Image instead of waiting towards the end.
