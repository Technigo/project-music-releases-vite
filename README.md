# Music Releases

This is a site that displays some of the latest albums released on Spotify.

### The Problem
We worked pretty quickly with the components and had the site running as we wanted to. Then we worked with the styling which was much harder. We struggled with the display of the icons, until we found the absolute-position and combined it with setting the album to position: relative.

Then we worked with the hovering-effects and the opacity of the icons. They continued to have a low opacity even when we hovered over them. We tried using the brightness-filter instead but that didn't work. Then we tried moving around the opacity command to different div:s until it worked the way we wanted to.

If we had more time we would work with the advanced stretch-goals as well.
