## The task
The task was to create a grid using data from a json-file ressembling Spotify. We were supposed to use map() to make them show up, and the albums should also show icons when you hover them.

## The roblem
For me it was quite a big project, especially since we just had started with vite and I had never mapped out objects from json file in that way. I used chat-gpt alot, and since I was a bit behind I had a great use of my class mates who was a big help.
