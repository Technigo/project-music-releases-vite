# Music Releases

Week 5
Practice with React with Spotify API.
Music Releases Project

## Getting Started with the Project

Started by creating the necessary components for this project, then attempted to render them within the Album element and pass them to the parent component, App.jsx

### The Problem

During the project, I faced some hurdles in getting the right data to flow between different parts of the app. This was particularly tricky when passing data from parent components to their children. Another headache was getting the styling to look consistent across all components.

It took some trial and error to make sure the styles were applied correctly to each part of the app. Overall, it taught me the importance of careful testing and keeping things tidy in the code to avoid these issues.

If I had more time, I would have delved deeper into the data to pass additional information and explore more styling options. There's always room for experimentation and refinement, and given the chance, I would have enjoyed exploring different possibilities to enhance the app further.
