# Music Releases

In this project I built a spotify top-50 album list with react. 
### The Problem

The challenge was to fetch data.json data and pass the props correctly to get the components to communicate.

The rest was styling and structure, which in the first submission will be missing play-icon and other CSS design requirements.
