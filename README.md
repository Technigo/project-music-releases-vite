# Music Releases

An application showing recent album and singles releases created using React. Props and working with components was in focus during the creation of the application. Working with Spotifys API to display the latest album and singles. 

### The Problem

A fun project, the thing I was struggling most with was the responsive design - I solved it by researching and talking to ChatGPT. I have added some comments in the code for me to understand and go back for a reminder use.
