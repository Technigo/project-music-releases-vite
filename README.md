# Music Releases

This weeks project was a new releases music album library made in React that should connect to Spotify. It was the first project we've worked on with React.

### The Problem

I also did  this week's project solo since I was going out of town on Thursday morning, so I only had Monday-Wednesday to finish the project and didn't want to stress anyone else. I thought it was harder than usual to navigate this weeks project since everything felt very new and unknown, but as soon as I got the foundation laid out and got the different jsx files to collaborate with each other, it went pretty smoothly I must say.
