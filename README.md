# Music Releases

The assignment is to build a music site with new Albums and singles as close to the design sketches and information provided in the instrtuctions using react.

## Getting Started with the Project

Getting the project started was easy after the tuesdays coding session, before it seemed impossible.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I created all files and started to connect them to eachother, had some issues with i but solved it after a break, had alot of other error during this project but with help from chatgpt,slack and stack overflow i solved it.
