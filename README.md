# Music Releases

This is a project where I was supposed to make a page that displayed newly released music albums.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I found this project super hard! It took me a lot of time to understand how it all worked, with the parent- and child components. 
I've used the videos provided by Technigo, slack, talked to team mates, googled, used chatGPT, youtube, looked at others project on GitHub.. You name it. Still didn't get it. 
So my site doesnt work, it doesn't display anything. And the code is basically just a mess. If i had more time I hope I'd be able to figure it out and make the site work..

I hope next week will be better for me. 

The non-existing site is deployed here:
https://musicreleasesw5.netlify.app/

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
