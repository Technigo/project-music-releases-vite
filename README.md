# Music Releases

First React project, mission was to display music releases with working hyper-links and sorting.

### The Problem

Created components for Album and Header, populated the Album components with sub-components for artist, album, image and an image overlay. We tried to keep the different functions separate. Deployed the animation and side-bar as well as a sort function.
