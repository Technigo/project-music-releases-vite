# Music Releases

The week 5 project was to create a music release website by using react framework. The API was already provided for us.

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We had some difficulties in the beginning that cost us a lot of time figuring out. A lot of time has past until we actually could have started the project.

As soon as we managed to connect the components, the styling got extremly fast.

If we could change something, we probably would make sure that our equiptment is up to date. Because this cost us too much time. We also wanted to add buttons to display the albums and singles separatly. But were running out of time, therefore we deleted the idea from our code.
