# Music Releases

The task is to develop a web page that displays new album releases and single releases.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Initially, I structured React components such as App, Header, and Album, striving to grasp the fundamentals of component-based development. I utilized .map() to iterate through the album data, a concept I had recently learned, to dynamically render each album's details. As I delved deeper, I encountered challenges in implementing hover effects and ensuring the app's responsiveness across various devices. However, through research and experimentation with CSS, I managed to overcome these hurdles. Reflecting on this experience, I recognize the value of hands-on learning and am eager to continue honing my skills as a web developer.
