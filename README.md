# Music Releases

To create a page that displays released albums and singles from spotify.

### The Problem

We started to break down what we needed to do for the requirements and looked at the design. Then we fetched the data needed and created components, once we had the data we styled it accordingly to the desgin, like hovering effects and icons.

If we had more time we would have played around more with the data and added extra features.
