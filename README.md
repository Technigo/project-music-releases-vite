# Music Releases

This weeks project was to display album data from the Spotify API using React Components.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I started with building the albume component after finalizing the design I broke the album component down into several smaller components. I have been using the console a lot to figure out how to solve the problems I encountered. If I had more time I would have been focusing a bit more on the styling part.
