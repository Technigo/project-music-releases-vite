# React + Vite

 #Music Releases
 The assignment was to create a site with new music album and singles, the design should be close enough to the example, the site should be responsive and have different components. 

 #The problem
 I  started with different components and linking them togehter, connecting all the data. I used props and import and export from and to different jsx-files.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
