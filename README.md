# Music Releases
This week’s project in the Technigo boot camp was to build a website showing the latest album releases from a Spotify API, by writing JSX and using React components. 

## The Problem

The real struggle with this project was to get a hang of how information is passed through the components using props. 

At first I was very reluctant to make a separate component for the buttons and I was adding all the code for the buttons in the cover image component, but when I realised how much code the buttons needed I made a new component. And that was when it clicked for me why components are a great way of building code. They give you a really good overview of the code and it’s an easy way to pass data through the project. 

If I would do it again I would make an individual css sheet for every component. I was afraid of having too many files in the beginning, as I found it very intimidating, and wasn’t sure on how to link them, but at the end I saw the point of having the css split up, and that’s when I made and individual	style sheet for the buttons. If I had more time I would continue structuring the CSS based on each component.

This week my team and chatGPT has been a fantastic help, as it has been really hard to wrap ones head around the logic of React. But as the week went by I realised I was understanding more and more about how components and props work. I still struggle to master the syntax of JSX.
