# Music Releases

This weeks assignment was to create a responsive site displaying new album and single releases using React.

### The Problem

We first connected all the files and components and to understand how everything was connected we created a flow-chart in Figma. Then we the components and connected them to the parent. 

Our main problem was understanding the connections between the components and what to import/export/where to use PropType. 

We also experienced som trouble inserting the comma (,) between our artists.

We used pair-programming and also did some asynchronous work partly in branches.

If we had more time we would look into the stretch goals.
