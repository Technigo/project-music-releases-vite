# Music Releases

This week, we will practice React and creating components that will use data from Spotify, which then transfer to its children's components using props. The task is to build a page that shows new albums and single releases.

## Getting Started with the Project
Step 1: Install Node.js
Step 2: Verify Node.js Installation Path on Windows
Step 3: Restart Git Bash in VS Code and then the setup is done

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

The #1 problem is how to get start with npm which took me some effort to identify the install of Node.js and set the right "Environment Variables" on my PC of the windows system.



### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
