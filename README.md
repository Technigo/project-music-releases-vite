# Music Releases

The project was about displaying spotify albums with album name and artists, following a specific design. In addition, the page should be responsive, have hover effects and icon-buttons.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

This project was really challenging. A lot of the time went on trying and adapting others codes, and asking Chat GTP. Some of it I was able to do with no help. The most challenging parts were the components and the icons. 

Do I understand how it works and what I have been doing? Kind of. Could I build this again? Not likely. (unless I did it with the same sources of help)

Two unsolved challenges:
The icons go darker along with the album hover - they should be on top on stay white
The albums should have a smaller size and space on the sides - did not have time for this
