# Music Releases

The assignment is to learn the basics of react and build a music site using API and links to artits and albums. Try to make the design as closely as possible to the design that was provided

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I've been using links and video that's provided. Googeling, using stack overflow and going throu the videos to solve problems that came up.
I've been using java script react with Vite for the first time to build this project.

I'm missing some part of the requrements:
Icons: when hovering the icons do not change scale and they are not white. Couldn't manage to change the color or scale to them.

Link on artist name: when clicking the artist name I dont get the link to the artist open in a new tab. I get this to work on the Album name but not on artist.

Commas: the commas in it's own line between the artists and the artists is in their own lines.
