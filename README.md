# Music Releases

React app showcasing 50 album releases via spotify's API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I started the project by really understanding the concepts of how React works. Then I defined the UI and created components from the design. I started with the top component and created props to passa data to child components. Finally I focused on the CSS to try to make the site look as much as possible to the design request provided.
