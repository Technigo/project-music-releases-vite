# Music Releases

### The Problem

We worked mostly asynchronously as our schedules were different, but met in between for short updates. 
Vittoria started by setting up the structure and connecting the elements. Then we worked independently on different parts of the code. 
The next step would be to work on the styling of the sidebar, as it is very small in the mobile version.
