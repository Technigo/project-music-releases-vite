# Project Music Releases

This week we practiced React and creating components that used data from Spotify, and transfered the data to its children components using props. We built a page which shows new album and single releases.

### The Problem

This project is the first we have done in React and it's been challenging working with props but also figuring out where to put everything since it's much more split up now with different components. Also connecting everything together accordingly and organizing it in different folders took some effort. At deployment it turned out that the icons only showed as a broken image, therefore the icon svg files had to be moved and can now be found in the public folder. For this project there have been a lot of team discussions and problem solving, since there were a lot of "new" problems for us. I have used chatGPT, for example with clarifying things in the code that needed adjusting or help with descriptive comments for the code. I have also watched some YouTube clips about React, video and reading material provided from Technigo.
