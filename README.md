# Music Releases

The project was to do your own version of a spoitifypage using their api and starting with react.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

First i struggled with the instructions and then with the structure of the project, it took some time to understand how all the pieces fitted together, and still not sure I got it right. I also still have difficulties with the responsive design but I think i pulled it off after some struggles with getting the play/fave/ellipse centered on the album.
