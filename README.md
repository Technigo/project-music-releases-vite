# Music Releases

This weeks project was to build a New music release site with React and with API from Spotify.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I just started writing the basic code for all react and files. I think this was easier than our preivious project, have no id√©a why. I used our school material, searched in Stack Overflow, google, the q&a, Chat gpt. I would do the extra if I had more time to add more functions to the site, this was fun and hard!
