# Music Releases

For week 5 we should create a react project that uses components to display a list of music albums.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I followed the instructions closely untill the basic requirements were met. Due to warnings in vsc I descided to add propTypes; don't know if this is acctually necessary or done correctly.

For the stretch with separating singles from albums, i wanted to add a navigation with anchored links. This does not seem to work in react, so those links arfe currently not working.

#### Next step

- I will try to make the navigation work, or remove it.
- Will take on the stretch of using the popular playlists.
- Look at the stretch for icons' opacity
