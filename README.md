# Music Releases

A project meant to simulate receiving a response from a version of Spotify's API and displaying it as a playlist

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

Data is extracted from the data.json file using mapping and then formatted and displayed using child-components.
My plan was to attempt to separate as much functionality as possible into different components to get more practice.
If I had had more time I would have delved deeper into svg manipulation.
