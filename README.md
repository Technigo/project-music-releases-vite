# Music Releases

Our first project practising basic React by creating a site that shows releases from Spotify using an API.

### The Problem

We first created a layout sketch using FigJam, to get an overview of the structure of the project componets. We looked at various resrouces, including Technigo exercises, alumni code, youtube videos, and got some help from ChatGPT explaining things.

We had some issues creating the comma between two artists but managed to make it after some research on different methods. If we had more time we would have also done the advanced strech goals.
