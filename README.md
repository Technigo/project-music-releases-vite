# Music Releases

A React app template to display albums. Features include a structured component hierarchy, design fidelity, hover effects, and responsive layouts. Clicking on albums or artists links to external URLs. Components provided; focus on data flow and UI interactions.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

No bigger issues during this week's project, but I encountered a few challenges in keeping the code DRY. I am really pleased with the outcome and the overall appearance of the app.

If I had more time, I would try fetching data from the Spotify API to make the app even more dynamic.
