# Music Releases

The assignment was to create a page showing new albums and single releases. Using React and data from Spotify.

### The Problem

I started out creating all the different components and then linked them together one by one. My biggest problem was the svg files. It took too much time figuring out how to use them and I wish I had reached out for help earlier.
If I had more time I would have individual CSS for every component because I got a bit lost in all the code, also should become better at adding comments to my code but I find it difficult for some reason.
