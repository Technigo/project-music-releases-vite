# Music Releases
This is the project from Technigo week 5, the start of the React sprint. This project includes the basics of React (components and props) and is displaying a music libary from a provided mimiquing of a Spotify API object endpoint. 

### The Problem

I approached the problem by dividing the project into smaller pieces and focusing on firslty getting the information to display from the components and then adding the styling. Structure was superimportant here with good classnames, names of the components and also folder structure for the components where I decided in the end to have Album (the parent component) alone and creating folders for its children with seperated design files to make the structure as clear as possible. My main tools to solve this was to look at my peers projects to get inspiration how to solve problems in different ways, chat gpt, a bit of Google, alot of thinking and trying different things out, talking with my team and watching the course material. And as always commenting the code after I feel finished with the project to both explain to myself what I have done but also so that people that look at my project understand. 

If I had more time I would try out the more advanced goals.
