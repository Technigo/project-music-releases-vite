# Music Releases

The mission was to start a Vite Development Server and try to emulate a page that shows new album releases with links to both albums and artists.

### The Problem

Early on I watched an introduction to React from Traversy Media on YouTube. He talked about the beauty of UseEffect. So I started a project and tested it out, before discovering that it is a hook and a topic for future projects. And a little too advanced for this week. So I decided to rework with "simpler" code. Trying to understand concepts like props etc. has been very challenging and something I'm still struggling to grasp. After an incredible amount of googling, messing with chatGPT, struggling with css, and some tips from demo sessions, I have a reasonably well-functioning project.
