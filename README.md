# Music Releases

This weeks project was to build a page with React that shows new albums and single releases.

### The Problem

I started by creating the structure and then passing the data between the different jsx files
Once the information I needed was printed as it should be, I began the styling. That was the part of the project that took the most time.

If you had more time, I would have fixed the transition on the cover image so the icons and the darker color fades in. And also rendered a list of playlists in a sidebar.
