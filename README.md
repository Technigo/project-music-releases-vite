# Music Releases

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Life - handing this in late, it's not perfect but I'm very happy to get it done.
