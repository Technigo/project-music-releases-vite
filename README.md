# Music Releases

Building a site that shows new albums and single releases. Practice React and creating components that will use data from Spotify, and then transfer to its children's components using props.The site should be responsive. 

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I worked on breaking down that problem into small bits. For example, the buttons in the overlay were easier to build by having the overlay always visible. So hiding the overlay unless the cover image had the cursor hovering over it was best to implement last, once the overlay itself was finished.
