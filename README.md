# Music Releases

This is a week 5 project at Technigo boot camp. This is a first week of React, and this project is careted using React and static data from spotify.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

The problem was to create eventlistener with React, as I am a beginner with React. I did reserach and took some courses about React to find out how to work with React. 
Placing eventListner right middle of JSX is so much easier than doing the same thing in JS files, and I found it very interesting.
