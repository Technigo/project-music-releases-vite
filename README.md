# Music Releases

A music website of new releases. artist profiles. 

### The Problem

This is the first time we work on React.js. During the project, we had a deeper understanding of relationship between parent comp and child comp. We struggled with prop and key. We read materials for learning the concept. Also searched similar quesions and posted quesions on stack over flow. It was very helpful and saved out time. We also used google and chatGPT to search how to write the hover, especially to change the icons' color. CSS and responsive design were quite challenge this week. 
We made the sidebar works, however we didn't have enough time to make the layout looks better, so we had to delete.
