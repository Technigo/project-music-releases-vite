# Music Releases

A responsive page built with React showing 50 albums.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

It was very difficult in the beginning to find the flow of building component even I understand
the concept. It was very easy to make mistake when I have too many variables in different places.
