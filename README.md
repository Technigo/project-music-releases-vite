# Music Releases

A web app to display albums, singles and latest playlists from Spotify. There was a specific design to be achived for the albumn component, which is linked in the instruction at the end of this file.

Developers: Pernilla Sterner, Sebastian Tigerschi√∂ld (seti108)

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

#### Planning and pair programming
We started by looking at all the specific problems to solve in this weeks assignment. Once we did that, we split the problems into smaller tasks. Then we started out pair programming to get the data from the json-object as well as building our first React Component. We had a few challenges in this stage of development, like:

* Finding the right folder structure for the project, like diving the files into folders, componentes and child-components
* Understanding how to use React Properties and how they are inherited from parent to children.
* How to pass json-data into different components, like to a child component
* Understanding the syntax in React/JSX for returning JSX from the component

#### Execution in branches
Once we got a grip on the above mentioned things, we went ahead and divided the tasks between us, working in branches.

We had a deadline for the project and on that day, we did pair programming to test the site and fix bugs and details.

#### Some possible impreovements
If we were to spend more time on the project, we would probably try to structure the files in the project in a different way. Maybe into parent components in a separate folder, with all it's child components in the same folder as the parent.

Further we would implement Sass to get a cleaner CSS code and to be able to style the applications more efficiently with less conflicts.
