# Music Releases


This project is a web application that displays new music releases, including albums and singles. It provides information about the latest music releases, such as album covers, artist names, release dates, and more.

## Getting Started with the Project

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Install project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install

4. Open the project in your code editor, for example, Visual Studio Code:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The web application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:3000 or other

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I approached the problem of displaying new music releases by creating a React-based web application. We used various technologies, including React for building the user interface, JavaScript to handle data, and CSS for styling.

My project's main goal was to provide users with an easy-to-use interface to discover and explore new music releases. Users can see album covers, artist details, and release dates.

If we had more time, we would enhance the application by adding user authentication and the ability to play music tracks directly from the Spotify API. like the following steps: Create a New Component, Import Spotify Web API Library, Set Up Authentication, Integrate Playback, Import and Use in App
