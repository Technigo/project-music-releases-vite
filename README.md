# Music Releases

This project entails building a responsive React web application that displays music album releases, mimicking a user experience similar to browsing on Spotify. It focuses on component-based architecture, utilizing React for UI development, and includes features like hover effects and external routing to album and artist pages.


### The Problem

The challenge was to efficiently structure and style the application to match provided design sketches closely, ensuring responsiveness across devices. It involved handling data from a JSON file, implementing React components and state management, and creating interactive UI elements.
